        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Two students were assigned to write a research paper about the benefits of machines replacing linemen in high risk situations after disaster, whether it be natural or manmade. They were asked to include interviews from residents’ and linemens’ experiences with the Ice Storm of 2000. </p>
    
    <header class="header is-size-4">Ice Storm of 2000</header>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">One of the most well known storms, in the history of Arkansas, was the Ice Storm of 2000. This storm caused power outages of multiple occasions, which lasted from two days to two weeks, depending on the area in which you lived. `Some residents lost their power the day they got it back from the first storm. One resident stated that between the fallen limbs and ice, it was impossible to see the ground.  
        One of the main issues caused by the storm, was the lack of food. Since food could not be stored in refrigerators and grocery stores, such as Walmart and Brookeshires, rationing food became a necessity. Another issue caused by the storm was the difficult cleanup process. Since falling limbs and active wires were a risk for linemen, it took some areas six months to rebuild.</p>
        
    <header class="header is-size-4">Benefits of Machines</header>
        <p>Machines can replace linemen in several high risk situations such as reconnecting fallen wires, clearing debris, such as fallen limbs, searching for fallen victims, and providing food for “snowed in” towns. This can prevent several life threatening injuries or even death. Several injuries include linemen falling their deaths, electrocution, being crushed by a rotten pole, and frostbite. Overall, machines provide a beneficial alternative to linemen in the case of a disaster.</p>
