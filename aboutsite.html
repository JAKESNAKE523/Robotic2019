        <div class="content">
            <p>The design of this website was chosen with our situation
               in mind.  A dark mode was implemented as a convenience as well as a nod to the
               power outage based game that the robot will compete in.  The website also is a
               mobile-first design.  We focused on phones and mobile devices because most people
               at competition will have their phone with them and will likely view the site that 
               way.  This doesn't mean that the desktop site was neglected, just that we focused 
               on our target audience.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The website programming and design was done by Jake Williams.  Various members of the team were consulted for opinions on design.  The Icebreaker's logo on the main page of the website was done by Gentry Needham.  The image credit goes to all-free-download.com and we are using the image with proper credit to them.</p>

        <header class="header is-size-3 is-size-4-mobile">Development</header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The site was built using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.  Bulma CSS framework was used for its versatility and more effecient devlopment speed.  The site and its source is hosted on github.</p>
